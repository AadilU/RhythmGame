DISCLAIMER: this converter is only for people who have osu and know how to use the
editor. If you don't have osu there's no point in using this lol.

Hello there wiz team, I made a converter so for the types of files that we'll be using.
If you look in converted files/example.wiz you'll see it has 3 different numbers on each line.

1. the x position of the note
2. the y position of the note (always 192 since its mania)
3. the time the note is hit in milliseconds

I made this file to show you how to use this converter so if you have any mania maps
you can use this converter but you are going to do a few things first.

First go into the osu editor for your map and make sure that every note is a normal 
note and not a long note. Then after that press ctrl + a and make sure no object has
any sort of sample sound. Make every note have an auto sound and each one has no
additional sounds. Now you can move the file into the scuffed-osu folder

Open the file once it's in the folder and in the file you will find a long list of numbers 
where each line looks something like 448,192,2392,1,0,0:0:0:0: above those lines 
you will see something titled [HitObjects] make sure to delete everything above it 
including the [HitObjects] line.

Now you can run the converter and it will prompt for the file you want. make sure to 
copy and paste it and if you did it correctly, there should be a new folder that has the
same format as the example.wiz. and that's how you use the converter. Sorry it's so long
lol.
